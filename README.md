Step 1: Design Smart Contracts
Design Lock Contract: Define the Solidity smart contract for locking tokens on the EVM side. This contract should include functions to lock ERC20 tokens or native ETH and emit events upon locking tokens.

Design Release Contract: Create the smart contract for releasing tokens on the non-EVM side. This contract should include functions to release tokens upon receiving confirmation from the EVM side and verify the authenticity of lock events.


Step 2: Deploy Contracts
Deploy Lock Contract: Deploy the lock contract on an EVM-compatible blockchain like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

Deploy Release Contract: Deploy the release contract on a non-EVM chain like Solana or Tezos.

Step 3: Set Up Oracle Service
Implement Oracle Service: Develop an oracle service that monitors events emitted by the lock contract on the EVM side.

Event Verification: Implement logic in the oracle service to verify the authenticity of lock events.

Cross-Chain Communication: Implement mechanisms for cross-chain communication, such as calling functions on the release contract or broadcasting messages to a cross-chain communication protocol.

Step 4: Test and Integration
Test Lock Contract: Test the lock contract by locking tokens and verifying that events are emitted correctly.

Test Release Contract: Test the release contract by simulating the receipt of messages from the oracle service and ensuring tokens are released appropriately.

Integration Testing: Integrate the lock contract, release contract, and oracle service to ensure seamless communication and functionality between the EVM and non-EVM chains.

Step 5: Deployment and Monitoring
Deployment: Deploy the integrated system comprising the lock contract, release contract, and oracle service.

Monitoring: Monitor the deployed system for any issues or anomalies, and implement appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms.

Step 6: Security Audit
Security Audit: Conduct a security audit of the deployed contracts and system to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

Bug Bounty Program: Consider setting up a bug bounty program to incentivize the community to identify and report security issues.
